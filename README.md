# DataKit-eBPF System And Network Tracing

DataKit's ebpf external collector's network-related data collection and offset derivation of kernel structure elements are based on [tcptracer-bpf](https://github.com/weaveworks/tcptracer-bpf) and [datadog-agent network pkg ](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/main/pkg/network) developed.
